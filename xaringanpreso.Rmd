# Summary: Sentinel 1

.pull-left[* Two polar-orbiting satellites
* The only Sentinel mission to provide Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery
* Allows for day and night imagery regardless of weather
* Focus (land) `r Citep(myBib, "esaLandMonitoringSentinel12022")``: 
  * Forest management
  * Agriculture monitoring
  * Urban deformation mapping
* Also used in marine monitoring and emergency management]

# Summary 2: Mission Purpose

* Radar mapping of Earth

* Bi-weekly coverage of world's land masses, as well as sea-ice zones, and Europe's coastal zones and shipping routes (daily)

  

  


---

# Summary 3: SAR

* Carries a single C-band SAR instrument
* This allows the satellite to "see through clouds"

## Key attributes:

| **Resolution** |                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Spatial        | As low as 5x5m, 400km swath                   |
| Temporal       | 6 days at equator, 3 days at higher latitudes |
| Radiometric    | 1 dB                                          |

# Applications: Maritime monitoring

## CHECK THIS SLIDE

* Used to detect and track objects in the oceans (ships, icebergs)
* Also used for detection of oil spills, which appear darker than water in SAR imagery 
* Near real-time temporal resolution means that it can be used to track and persecute illegal oil spills
* Also used for ice classification and iceberg data by coast guards, navies, and private shipping companies

# Applications: Land monitoring

* Forestry: Forest type classification, biomass estimation, disturbance detection
* Mapping of fire scars
* Monitoring crop conditions, soil properties, assessing land use, soil degradation
* Can be combined with optical data from other sources to improve the accuracy of informal settlement detection and mapping
  * Needs to be ground-truthed in this context
  * Spatial resolution not always high enough
  * Speckle an issue

# Applications: Emergency management

* Phase data can be used for interferometric (InSAR) analysis - used for measuring surface deformations caused by seismic events and volcanic activities
* Also used to assess damage after other natural disasters
* High spatial and temporal resolution combined with all-weather imagery is a huge advantage here
