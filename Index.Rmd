# Summary: Sentinel 1

.pull-left[* Two polar-orbiting satellites
* The only Sentinel mission to provide Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery
* Allows for day and night imagery regardless of weather
* Focus (land) `r Citep(myBib, "esaLandMonitoringSentinel12022")``: 
  * Forest management
  * Agriculture monitoring
  * Urban deformation mapping
* Also used in marine monitoring and emergency management]

```

# Summary 2: Purpose

* Continuous radar mapping of Earth `r Citep(myBib, "esaSentinel1MissionObjectives2022")`
* Bi-weekly coverage of world's land masses, as well as sea-ice zones and Europe's coastal zones and shipping routes (daily)
* Expected mission duration: Minimum 7 years; fuel for 12 years 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "70%", fig.show='hold', fig.align= 'center', fig.cap= "Sentinel 1P Coverage (Source: European Space Agency, 2022)"}

# Summary 3: SAR

* Sentinel 1 carries a single C-band SAR instrument
* Imagery produced using radio waves, not visible light - active sensor
* This allows the sensor to see through clouds (operates at a different point on the electromagnetic spectrum)


## Key attributes:

| **Resolution** |                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Spatial        | As low as 5x5m, 400km swath                   |
| Temporal       | 6 days at equator, 3 days at higher latitudes |
| Radiometric    | 1 dB                                          |
| Spectral       | Single C-band                                 |

# Applications: Maritime Monitoring

* Used to detect and track objects in the oceans (ships, icebergs)
* Also used for detection of oil spills, which appear darker than water in SAR imagery 
* Near real-time temporal resolution means that it can be used to track and persecute illegal oil spills
* Also used for ice classification and iceberg data by coast guards, navies, and private shipping companies `r Citep(myBib, "tschadaUsingSentinel1SAR2022")`



---

# Applications: Land monitoring

* Forestry: Forest type classification, biomass estimation, disturbance detection
* Mapping of fire scars
* Monitoring crop conditions, soil properties, assessing land use, soil degradation `r Citep(myBib, "esaLandMonitoringSentinel12022")`
* Can be combined with optical data from other sources to improve the accuracy of informal settlement detection and mapping `r Citep(myBib, "matariraObjectBasedInformalSettlement2022")`
  * Needs to be ground-truthed in this context
  * Spatial resolution not always high enough
  * Speckle an issue

---

# Applications: Emergency management

* Phase data can be used for interferometric (InSAR) analysis - used for measuring surface deformations caused by seismic events and volcanic activities `r Citep(myBib, "esaEarthquakesVolcanicEruptions2022")`
* Also used to assess damage after other natural disasters
* High spatial and temporal resolution combined with all-weather imagery is a huge advantage here
* Unfortunately this is not possible in Google Earth Engine at the moment

# Reflections: SAR vs Optical
A short video... for fun! Here I demonstrate how an aperture works on an optical camera

# Reflections: SAR vs Optical continued

.pull-left[* SAR works differently - the sensor produces its own energy (radio waves)
* The antenna on the satellite reads the signal that bounces back
* This creates a synthetic aperture - the spatial resolution of an image is determined by the length of the antenna `r Citep(myBib, 'nasaWhatSyntheticAperture2020')`
* This is why SAR can see through clouds - it's not reading light!]
